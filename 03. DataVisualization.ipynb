    "# A Final Note on Plotting:\n",
    "The best plots that you can make are probably ones that are completely custom to the task or question you are trying to solve/answer. These plots are also the most difficult to get correct because they take a great deal of iteration, time, and effort to get perfected. They also take some time to explain. There is a delicate balance between creating a new plot that answers exactly what you are asking (in the best way possible) and spending and inordinate amount of time on a new plot (when a standard plot might be a \"pretty good\" answer)\n",
